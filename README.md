# GreatEditionNumbers

((((get a gif))))

This plugin adds an edition number to the crafting recipes you choose.
The first time a crafting recipe is made on a server, it will be given edition #1, and then the second gets #2, and so on.
This originally started as a fun idea for my friends' survival server, but I thought I'd share the love.

## Installation and Usage

Download the jar file, place it in the plugins folder, and restart the server once so the plugin generates a config file.

Then, all the configuring is in the `config.yml` file in the `plugins/GreatEditionNumbers` folder.
Follow the instructions in there!

There are no commands or permissions to learn. The plugin just works!
